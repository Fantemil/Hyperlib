# Welcome to Hyperlib!

Hyperlib is a Project i started for everyone who is tired of always searching for Scripts on YouTube. And that keyless of course because key systems suck! 
I promise that you will never need a key and i will never obfuscate the main source code.

# Features
## Implemented:
- [x] Manipulate Walkspeed, Jumppower and Gravity
- [x] Server Hop, Rejoin and Exit
- [x] Chat Clear
- [x] Thousands of Universal/Game Scrips and Hubs at your disposal
- [x] A GUI Manager to remove other annoying and unclosable exploit GUIs you executed
- [x] A powerful search tool with filters to search for your favorite Script without needing to manually find it.
## Might be implemented at some time in the Future:
- [ ] A favoriting System
- [ ] Online Functionality (Liking Scripts, saving Scripts in the cloud, etc...)


# How it works

To offer such a huge amount of Scripts i programmed a Bot that fetches Roblox Scripts every hour from various sites like scriptblox.com and then uploads them onto here. Note though that the Bot does not know if a Script is working so you may encounter scripts that won't work.

# How to run

You can run Hyperlib with a easy loadstring.
```
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fantemil/Trenglehub/main/trenglehub.lua"))()
```


# How to contribute

If you want to add a Script to the Hub feel free to join the Hyperlib Discord https://discord.gg/PCBRyautZq and submit your Script to the Bot in the dedicated Channel.
If you want to contribute changes to the main Script just open a pull request. To suggest changes just join the Discord.
