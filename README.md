# Welcome to Hyperlib!

Hyperlib is a Project i started to offer people a script, which is a big hub with many scripts for many games. And that keyless of course! 
You will never need a key and i will never obfuscate the script. Hyperlib on its own is completely Open-Source BUT Scripts contained may be obfuscated.

# Checklist

- [x] More Things at the Player Tab
- [x] Adding Gamehubs automatically through the bot

# Hyperlib is special! But i need help.

Hyperlib uses a Python Selenium bot to add new scripts to the Hub automatically! Though, The Bot does not know if a Script isnt working of course. Because of that please report Scripts that aren't working to fantemil on discord, or just open a issue

# How to run

You can run Hyperlib with a easy loadstring or just copy the source code (not recommended since updates won't be included then). You can also find Hyperlib in the Script-Ware Script Library.
```
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fantemil/Trenglehub/main/trenglehub.lua"))()
```


# HELP ME!

I need a lot of help improving the Hub! If you want to contribute then please send me your scripts or ideas on discord or make a pull request/issue!!! (discord: fantemil)
