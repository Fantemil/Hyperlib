# Welcome to Hyperlib!

Hyperlib is a Project i started to offer people a script, which acts as a big hub with many scripts for many games. And that keyless of course! 
You will never need a key and i will never obfuscate the script. Hyperlib on its own is completely Open-Source BUT Scripts contained may be obfuscated.

# Hyperlib is special! But we need help.

Hyperlib uses a Python Selenium bot to add new scripts to the Hub automatically! Though, The Bot does not know if a Script isnt working of course. Because of that please report Scripts that aren't working to Fantemil#2549 on discord
# How to run

You can run Hyperlib with a easy loadstring (or copy the source code)
```
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fantemil/Trenglehub/main/trenglehub.lua"))()
```


# HELP US!

We are needing alot of Help to finding new Scripts or improving the Hub! If you want to contribute then please send me your scripts on discord or make a pull request!!! Fantemil#2549
