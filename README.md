Roxerion is the next generation of Hyperlib — rebuilt from the ground up as a full web platform with thousands of scripts, a modern in-game hub, and powerful new features.

### What's new in Roxerion

- **30,000+ Scripts** — crawled and updated automatically from multiple sources
- **Web Platform** — browse, search, like, favorite, and upload scripts at [roxerion.com](https://roxerion.com)
- **Modern In-Game Hub** — Apple-style dark UI with real-time search, categories, favorites, and cheats
- **User Accounts** — sign up, upload your own scripts, manage favorites across devices
- **Discord Integration** — login with Discord, upload scripts from Discord, announcements
- **RoxGuard Obfuscator** — free Lua obfuscation tool at [roxerion.com/obfuscation](https://roxerion.com/obfuscation)
- **Key System** — configurable monetization (or completely free mode)
- **Script Health Tracking** — see which scripts are stable, unstable, or dead
