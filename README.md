# Welcome to Trenglehub!

Trenglehub is a Project i started to offer people a script, which acts as a big hub with many scripts for many games. And that keyless of course! 
You will never need a key and i will never obfuscate the script. Trenglehub on its own is completely Open-Source BUT Scripts contained may be obfuscated.

# How to run

You can run Trenglehub with a easy loadstring (or copy the source code)
```
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fantemil/Trenglehub/main/trenglehub.lua"))()
```
# Informations

Sometimes i just dont add scripts when they are requiring you to do some extra steps.
