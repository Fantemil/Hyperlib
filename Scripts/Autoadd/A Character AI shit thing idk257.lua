    not by me of course

	I am not affiliated with Character.AI or anything like that. 
	Itâ€™s just a project I did for fun. 
	I only use the API that I created using Web Scraping, 
	which is a technique to extract data from websites. 
	Therefore, this script is not endorsed or supported by the Character.AI team.

	IMPORTANT:

	- If "YourToken" isn't set, the script logs in as a guest.

	    - Why you should get a token:
          - Guest can only send like 5 messages to a Character.
          - Guests cannot search for characters.
	
	    - With Character.AI, you can send as many messages as you want for free. 
        - The token is valid forever, so you only need to get it once.

	- Setting "WaitAnswer" to true makes the script wait for the bot's 
	  response before generating another one. This can help prevent flooding 
	  the chat with messages, but it also means the script won't be able 
	  to read incoming messages while waiting for a response.

    - Setting "WaitAnswer" to false makes the script respond quickly 
	  without waiting for the bot's response. This can be useful for 
	  certain scenarios, but it may flood the chat with messages.
