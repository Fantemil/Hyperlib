-- When the player right-clicks, the script will automatically fire continuously. 
-- When the player left-clicks, the script will fire a single bullet. If the player were to regularly hold the left click to allow the gun to go full auto, the silent aim would not go into full effect.
-- Due to the way I manipulate the camera, it is necessary to implement the shooting mechanics in this specific manner.
-- WORKS ON ALL EXECUTORS
