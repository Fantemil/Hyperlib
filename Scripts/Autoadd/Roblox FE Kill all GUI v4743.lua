-- Script Description:
-- This script is designed for use in the Roblox game and adjusts the player's position using CFrame manipulation on the client side.
-- It helps you move players to a specified distance in front of your character and set their walk speed to 0.(Depend)
-- This means you can use tools and items such as swords and guns in the game, as this script is created to handle the Hitbox on the client side.
-- You can use those tools to damage/attack/kill players who are moved near you.
-- Although this script works on the client side, other players can still see themselves being killed/attacked/damaged.
-- This may not work in games with strict anti-cheat systems or Hitbox verification.
