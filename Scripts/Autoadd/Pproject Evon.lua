     Discord Server Coming Soon!
     
     Project Has Many Security Features To Make Sure Your Account Is Safe.
    One Of Which Is The Account Security Whenever Project Evon Is Booted Up.
    Whenever We Detect A User Using Project Evon We Scan The Server For The User, And Ask The User If You Are The Person Using The Script.
    If You Click "No", Then It Will Force Close All Instances Of Project Evon Attached To The LocalPlayer And The Security Brecher.
    I Hope You Enjoy What Project Evon Has In-Store!
