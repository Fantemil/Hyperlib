-- Some Ui's are hidden to prevent spam, I may change the script so instead of Cframe teleportation the parts in workspace are teleported to you, if anyone would like to edit the script to their liking, source code is available, just follow through the urls, for anyone whos too lazy to execute a dex, in workspace, the folder for all the checkpoints is "Checkpoints", make sure its capital, and then the current parts are 1-261. Like I said, will optimize this script performance wise and efficiently wise later. have fun expliting!
