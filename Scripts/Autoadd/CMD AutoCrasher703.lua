Hello, another release. I hate this game so I'm going to release an auto crasher for it. 

Put in autoexec folder of your executor. If you are stuck on a loading screen, or you get an error, use infinite yield to server hop/rejoin. (it's executed for you)

DONT JUST EXECUTE IN YOUR EXECUTOR IT WILL ONLY CRASH ONCE LMAO^ AUTOEXEC

! Beware this crasher is flashy so don't use if you have epilepsy !

Want more scripts like this? Join the CMD discord! 1,700+ members and counting, I release scripts for free.
