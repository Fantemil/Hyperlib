First Script Execute this first. this fires the ShopBuy remote event, this giving you the âburgerâ tool without needing money
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://pastebin.com/raw/j4LbDdNn"))()

the second script equips all tools  except  âFlashlightâ tool
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://pastebin.com/raw/Fb16RAAR"))()

I didn't obfuscate it because I really don't care what you guys do 
NOTE : I have not tested on solara cuz I use wave monthly , sorry about that.
I also don't recommend it to execute on the phone because it can crash/break the phone.
