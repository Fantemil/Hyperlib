-- This page will be always updated no matter what.
-- BetterBypasser does not log anything.

-- If you want the new update or the new invis method, please change "Method" to 3
-- Want to see the words for Method 1? Please view the console to do so. We are planning to change this to a UI where it shows you the words instead
