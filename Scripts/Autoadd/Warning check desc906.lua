Roblox new update has caused every roblox bypasser including popular ones like cat bypasser and user creation. To stop working like whenever you press one or do auto it just, hashtags the message they said they are figuring out a way to fix it, and they should be working soon idk about other bypassers/chat bypassees. Those are the only 2 I know that are trying to fix it. I'm assuming someone put words/sentences on dev form for roblox mods to see and get them taken down. Or it could be skid sysgesta.
