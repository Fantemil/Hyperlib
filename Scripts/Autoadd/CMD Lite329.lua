Stuff this script doesn't HAVE:
1. person299 commands [building] - I have a life and I'm busy with stuff. it requires persons and I have it but these commands are hard to make.

Stuff in the works:
CMD PI features in general (cmd pi doesn't work on mobile so yh) ]]

getgenv().autoruncmds = {".antirocket me", ".tnok", ".antimsg me"} -- can be customised. If you remove this line it will just run the defaults in the actual script.

getgenv().theprefix = "." -- of any length. how nice :) (also you can make it nothing)
