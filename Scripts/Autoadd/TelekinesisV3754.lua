    FOR DA HOOD>>....
    
    IF YOU WANT TO FULLY CONTROL THE PLAYER YOU WOULD HAVE TO THROW THE PLAYER AND IT WORKS.
    
    IF SOMEONE GETS CLOSE TO THE PLAYER THAT YOU ARE CONTROLLING, YOU WILL LOSE POWER SO TRY TO ASK THEM TO MOVE.
    
    IF YOU JOINED A NEW SERVER AND YOU EXECUTED THE SCRIPT, MAKE SURE YOU EXECUTE THEN RESET SO YOU CAN HAVE MORE POWER. -- if necessary or not but important
    
    THIS IS JUST A BETA TELEKINISIS SCRIPT.
