keypress(0x10,true) -- ctrl 
keypress(0x11,true) -- shift 
keypress(0x1B,true) -- escape

-- ctrl + shift + esc -> Opens task manager
-- now since solaras keypress is a bit weird you'd prb have to run this multiple times for it to work since solara sometimes doesnt register the function being called for some reason?
