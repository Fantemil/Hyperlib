! Some of features only work when script is placed inside autoexec (autoexecution) folder of your exploit. Also recommended to add "!!!" in script name, ex. "!!!_TLGUI.luau" for better effect.
! Some of features only work on certain executors like SYNAPSE X
* Config Explanation appears as second file after you save config. It has "EXPLANATION" in the name.
* If EXPLANATION and/or CONFIG arent present then your executor either doesnt support writing/reading files (check console) or there was an error
Got questions/long messages? Contact on Discord [deuces#1961] - *Copy Insides of brackets*
If you dont need an answer from me - use the FEEDBACK in Settings
